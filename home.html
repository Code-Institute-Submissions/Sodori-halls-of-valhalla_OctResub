            <h2>Welcome to the halls!</h2>
            <p>Here, you will have access to the stories of champions of all their sizes and numbers. No matter how small, big glorious or cowardise. Everyone has a right to be within these halls.</p>
            <p>Please, navigate to the library and relish in its records. Here, the champions are sorted into ID cards containing some brief knowledge, along with links to their sometimes multiple stories from multiple timelines.</p>
            <p>If you want to, you may submit your own champions, who will then be tested before Odin and his all seeing eye. If he deems your submission worthy, it will end up sharing space with all the other champions!</p>
