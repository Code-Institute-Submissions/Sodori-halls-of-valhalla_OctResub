# The halls of Valhalla

This site is a place to share works done for RolePlaying games. Hopefully, it can not only help display characters, but also inspire people not knowing what to create.

### Features Left to Implement

## Testing 

Thorough testing done using multiple explorers as well as rezising them in inspection mode as well as opening the document on my phone and tablet to ensure as pleasant of an experience on as many platforms as possible.

Most everything is responsive, and will scale to the needs of most any screen sizes and orientations today on the market.

During testing and debugging, I found it delightfully challenging to ensure propper allignment of character portraits alligned with complementary text. It took me plenty of tries, but I got there in the end!
